## Welcome!

The macpro-base-template project is a MACPRO microservice deployed to AWS which sends CMS Meidcaid Model Data Lab (MMDL) data to [CMS Bigmac](https://github.com/cmsgov/cms-bigmac) in realtime.  It deploys a [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html) service to ECS Fargate.  The Kafka Connect service is configured with a [JDBC Source connector](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connectors/jdbc/current/index.html), which watches MMDL's Oracle database for data changes and sends them to topics in CMS Bigmac.  AWS Lambda is used to create topics in Bigmac, as well as some other perform some other deployment operations.  Alerting is leveraged through AWS Cloudwatch.  

This project is under active development by the MACPRO Platform team.  Read on for more details, and feel free to join us on [Slack](https://cmsgov.slack.com/archives/C0403M0D007).

Thanks, and we're glad you're here!
