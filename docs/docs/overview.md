## Overview

The mmdl-connectors project is a MACPRO microservice deployed to AWS which sends CMS Meidcaid Model Data Lab (MMDL) data to [CMS Bigmac](https://github.com/cmsgov/cms-bigmac) in realtime. It deploys a [Kafka Connect](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/connect/index.html) service to ECS Fargate. The Kafka Connect service is configured with a [JDBC Source connector](https://docs.confluent.io/kafka-connectors/jdbc/current/index.html), which watches MMDL's Oracle database for data changes and sends them to topics in CMS Bigmac. AWS Lambda is used to create topics in Bigmac, as well as some other perform some other deployment operations. [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/) is leveraged to unpack and combine the mmdl data from these topics and create tables on top of these streams to store un-nested data. [RocksDB](http://rocksdb.org/) is also storing this emphemerally on the ksqldb host. Alerting is leveraged through [AWS Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).
